## Project Motivation 
In this project, we test the quality of Course Management System Under Test to affirm the the SUT is a perfect fit for purpose software application 
and it meets the needs and expectations of users.

## Installation
This project uses Behavioral Driven Development where codes in feature files are writtten in plain language text - Gherkin language of Given(specifies condition), When (specifies action) and Then (specifies result) for easy understanding by the non technical stakeholders.
Thus, this project needs a mixture of tools such as
- Visual Studio (2019 recommended) 
- Specflow
- Selenium WebDriver

C sharp programming language is used in this project in a .Net environment

## File Descriptions
Since best practices for Object Oriented Programming such as encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism, interface and Page Object Model are employed, the files are separated into differenet folders namely:
- Features folder - containing the  feature files
- StepDefinitions folder - containing the StepDefinitions files
- BrowserFactories folder - containing the BrowserFactories files
- SetUp folder - containing the Setup files
